# Project Context Integration

Brainstorming is more effective when grounded in existing project knowledge.

## Using Knowledge Items (KIs)
Before starting Phase 1 of a creative session:
1.  **Search KI Summaries**: Look for KIs related to the project architecture, target audience, or past technical decisions.
2.  **Extract Constraints**: Identify Documented limits, styles, or patterns from KI artifacts.
3.  **Build Upon, Don't Rebuild**: Use existing KIs as the "floor" for your brainstorming rather than starting from zero.

## Using Conversation Logs
- **Identify User Preferences**: Search for past feedback or "I like/dislike..." statements from the user.
- **Avoid Repeated Failures**: Check if certain ideas or directions were previously rejected.
- **Identify "Vibe"**: Understand the user's preferred communication style and risk tolerance from past interactions.

## How to Reference Context
- "Based on our last discussion about [Topic]..."
- "According to the [Project Name] KI, we have a constraint on..."
- "I noticed in the logs that you previously mentioned [Fact]..."
