# Workflow: Structured Creative Session

Follow these steps to conduct a comprehensive brainstorming session.

## Phase 1: Preparation
1.  **Define the Problem/Opportunity**: State the goal in one sentence.
2.  **Gather Context**: List existing constraints, target audience, and current solutions.

## Phase 2: Divergence (Idea Generation)

1.  **Rapid Fire**: Spend 2-3 minutes generating as many raw ideas as possible. List them without judgment.
2.  **Framework Application**: Use a framework from [frameworks.md](./../resources/frameworks.md) to look at the problem from new angles.
3.  **Analogous Thinking**: How would a completely different industry (e.g., gaming, healthcare, aerospace) solve this?

## Phase 3: Convergence (Selection & Refinement)
1.  **Clustering**: Group similar ideas into themes.
2.  **Filtering**: Apply the "Impact vs. Effort" matrix.
3.  **Selection**: Pick the top 3-5 ideas for deeper exploration.

## Phase 4: Output
1.  **Detailed Proposals**: Elaborate on the selected ideas (Features, Benefits, Implementation path).
2.  **Action Plan**: Define the next steps to validate or prototype the best idea.
