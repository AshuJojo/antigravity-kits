# Brainstorm Skill

This skill provides a structured framework for generating new ideas, expanding features, and solving complex problems through creative thinking.

## Purpose
Use this skill when the user asks for:
- New product, feature, or business ideas.
- Creative solutions to complex problems in any domain.
- Expansion of existing concepts or projects.
- Structured brainstorming sessions.

## Skill Structure
The skill is modularized to provide specific guidance and examples:

- **Workflows**: Step-by-step guides for creative processes.
  - [Creative Session](./workflows/creative-session.md): A full structured brainstorming workflow.
- **Resources**: Tools and frameworks to aid ideation.
  - [Brainstorming Frameworks](./resources/frameworks.md): SCAMPER, First Principles, etc.
- **Examples**: Reference outcomes of brainstorming sessions.
  - [New Product Idea Example](./examples/new-product-idea.md).

## Strategy
1.  **Identify the Objective**: Clearly define what needs to be brainstormed.
2.  **Select a Framework**: Choose a relevant framework from [Resources](./resources/frameworks.md).
3.  **Execute Workflow**: Follow the [Creative Session](./workflows/creative-session.md) workflow.
4.  **Iterate and Refine**: Brainstorming is non-linear; feel free to jump between divergent and convergent thinking.

## Guidelines
- **Quantity over Quality (initially)**: Generate as many ideas as possible before filtering.
- **De-risking**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort ideas or those that solve critical pain points.
- **Modularity**: Refer agents to specific files within this skill based on the task context.
