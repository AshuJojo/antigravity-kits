- **Question**: "What is this, and why should I care? Is it easy to start?"

## 3. The Skeptic (Devil's Advocate)
- **Focus**: Risks, failure points, costs, privacy.
- **Question**: "Why is this a bad idea? What could go wrong? Is it worth it?"

## 4. The Visionary (Futurist)
- **Focus**: Innovation, disruption, 10x thinking.
- **Question**: "What would this look like in 50 years? How can we make this magical?"

## 5. The Penny-Pincher (CFO)
