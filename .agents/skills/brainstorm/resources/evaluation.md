# Idea Evaluation Frameworks

Use these frameworks during the convergence phase to rigorously analyze and select the best ideas.

## 1. SWOT Analysis
Evaluate an idea based on:
- **Strengths**: Internal factors that give the idea an advantage.
- **Weaknesses**: Internal factors that might hinder success.
- **Opportunities**: External factors the idea could exploit.
- **Threats**: External factors that could cause trouble.

## 2. Six Thinking Hats (Edward de Bono)
Look at the idea from six distinct perspectives:
- **White Hat (Facts)**: What information is available? What are the facts?
- **Red Hat (Emotions)**: What are your gut feelings? (Keep this brief).
- **Black Hat (Caution)**: What are the risks? Why might it fail?
- **Yellow Hat (Optimism)**: What are the benefits? Why will it work?
- **Green Hat (Creativity)**: What are the possibilities? How can it be grown?
- **Blue Hat (Process)**: Organizing the thinking. What is the next step?

## 3. Impact vs. Effort Matrix
Plot ideas on a 2x2 grid:
- **Quick Wins (Priority 1)**: High Impact, Low Effort. These are most valuable when combined with High Tech Leverage.
- **Big Bets**: High Impact, High Effort, High Tech Leverage.
- **Fill-ins**: Low Impact, Low Effort.
- **Thankless Tasks**: Low Impact, High Effort. (Avoid)

## 4. The NUFT Test
Score each idea from 1-10 on:
- **N**ew: Is it a fresh approach?
- **U**seful: Does it actually solve the problem?
- **F**easible: Can it actually be done? (Low difficulty/Easy to build).
- **T**ech Leverage: High tech dependency but low current adoption? (High tech edge).
  - *Priority Rule*: For ideas with similar Tech Leverage, **Feasibility** is the tie-breaker. Favor lower difficulty.
