# Overcoming Creative Blocks

If the "Raw Ideas" phase is stalling, try these techniques to jumpstart creativity.

## 1. The "Reverse" Brainstorm
Instead of asking "How do we solve this?", ask "**How can we make this problem even worse?**"
Once you have list of ways to sabotage the project, flip them into solutions.

## 2. Random Word Association
Pick a random object or word (e.g., "Umbrella", "Bicycle", "Coffee").
Ask: "How is this random object like our problem?" Use the association to spark a new angle.

## 3. Perspective Shift
- "How would a 5-year old solve this?"
- "How would a trillion-dollar company solve this?"
- "How would someone from the year 1900 solve this?"

## 4. Rubber Ducking
Explain the problem out loud (or in the chat) to an inanimate object. The act of explaining often reveals hidden assumptions or new paths.

## 5. Change the Constraints
- Remove the most annoying constraint.
- Add a ridiculous constraint.
- Assume you have unlimited resources.
