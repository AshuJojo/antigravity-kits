# Brainstorming Frameworks

Use these frameworks to stimulate creative thinking during the divergence phase.

## 1. SCAMPER
- **S**ubstitute: What can be replaced?
- **C**ombine: What can be merged?
- **A**dapt: What can be adjusted from another context?
- **M**odify/Magnify: What can be changed or enlarged?
- **P**ut to another use: How else could this be used?
- **E**liminate: What can be removed?
- **R**everse/Rearrange: What if we flipped the process?

## 2. First Principles Thinking
- Break the problem down into its fundamental truths.
- Reconstruct the solution from the ground up, ignoring "how it's always been done."

## 3. The 5 Whys
- Ask "Why?" five times to drill down to the root cause of a problem, then brainstorm solutions for that root cause.

## 4. Mind Mapping
- Start with a central theme and branch out into related concepts, features, and sub-problems.

## 5. Constraint-Based Brainstorming
- "What if we had $0 budget?"
- "What if this had to be delivered in 24 hours?"
- "What if this was only for power users?"
