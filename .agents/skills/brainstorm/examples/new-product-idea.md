# Example: Brainstorming a "Community Tool Library"

**Objective**: Create a neighborhood system for sharing expensive or rarely-used tools (drills, ladders, lawnmowers).

## Divergence Phase (Raw Ideas)
- A physical kiosk in the local park.
- Mobile app for booking and tracking tools.
- Subscription-based model ($5/month).
- "Tool parties" where neighbors learn to use specific tools.
- Insurance coverage for damaged tools.
- Peer-to-peer delivery service.

## Framework Applied: SCAMPER (Substitute & Combine)
- **Substitute**: Instead of a central library, use neighbors' garages as "micro-nodes."
- **Combine**: Merge the tool library with a "skill swap" program (borrow a drill + someone to help you use it).

## Selection (Top Ideas)
1.  **The Distributed Garage**: A mobile app that maps tools available in the neighborhood, using local residents as storage hosts.
2.  **Repair & Share Workshops**: Monthly meetups at a community center where tools are shared and repairs are taught.

## Refined Proposal: "Neighborhood Share-Node"
- **Key Feature**: A decentralized inventory system where users can see what tools are within a 10-minute walk.
- **Benefit**: Reduces individual consumption and builds community ties.
- **Next Step**: Conduct a survey in a local Facebook group to gauge interest and tool availability.
